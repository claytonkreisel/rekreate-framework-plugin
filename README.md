# ReKreate Framework Plugin
This is a framework for a plugin made by ReKreate Software Solutions. It helps you organize your project in an MVC type build

## MVC Approach
The idea behind this plugin is to help provide a MVC-esc style approach to WordPress theme development. One of the ways this accomplished is by totally moving all of the default views into a `views` folder in the themes root directory. This folder is where your `single.php`, `archive.php`, `taxonomy.php`, `header.php`, `footer.php`, etc... that normally sit on the theme's root will go.
